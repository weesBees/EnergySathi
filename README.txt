Temperature sensors:(SENSOR DONE) measure temp of surrunding enviornment and rooms

Light sensors:(SENSOR DONE) Measere the light in room and change the light based on occupancy and surroungidng light.

Motion sensors:(SENSOR DONE) detect occupancies and movements

Humidity sensors:(SENSOR DONE) monitor moisture in the air and rooms

Carbon dioxide/other gases sensors(SENSOR DONE): measure teh harmulf gass level to make more or less ventilation accordingly.

some type of elctric parameters measure and storing device:  to measeure the electric usage and t change it. Can be done by-
     1- hack multimeter(hard,cheap)
     2- buy a multimeter with this function(expensive,easy)
     3- get another deivce to do this thing(no clue about it)

1stWeek vyom- Prepare adivice to display values on lcd of sensors.
1-2 week vignesh- Prepaer a modle code with model data on how it will work.
NEXT- INTERGRATE THEM.
how we can integrete - we can use something with bluetooth or any other transmittion  that goes to an android phone then maybey we can  use android development to add python with it or somehting to process or we coude transmitt to a laptop or pc acitng as a server with pyhton code in it
Temperature and humidity-DHT11 SENSOR
Light -LDR sensor
Motion- PIR sensor
carbon DIOXIDE- MQ-135
SERACH FOR 2 WAY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PYTHON AND ARDUINO
Fan ON/OFF if co2 and temp.
Light On/off- LDR and motion sensor.
Widnow open witservo - if co2
AC- if temp
