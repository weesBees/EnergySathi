some type of elctric parameters measure and storing device:  to measeure the electric usage and t change it. Can be done by-
     1- hack multimeter(hard,cheap)
     2- buy a multimeter with this function(expensive,easy)
     3- get another deivce to do this thing(no clue about it)

1stWeek vyom- Prepare adivice to display values on lcd of sensors.
1-2 week vignesh- Prepaer a modle code with model data on how it will work.
NEXT- INTERGRATE THEM.
